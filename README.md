# Empowering Educational Interventions
<p>This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Educational Data Mining (EDM) framework developed for predicting student academic performance using advanced feature selection, sample optimization and classification techniques.</p>

## Key Features
- **Advanced Feature Selection (MATRICLUST-FS)**: Uses Matrix-driven Clustering and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify the most relevant features.
Removes redundant and irrelevant attributes to enhance model interpretability and accuracy.  
- **Hybrid Optimization Technique**: Integrates the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) with Cuckoo Search to optimize feature subsets.
Ensures efficient exploration and exploitation in feature selection..  
- **Intelligent Sample Selection (HYCADEX)**: Employs Kullback–Leibler divergence to select informative and representative samples.
Balances the dataset and improves learning on minority classes.
- **Enhanced Classification Models**: Implements COGNIFUZZ (Fuzzy-Neuro Prism) and OPTIFUZZTREE (Fuzzy-Neuro J48) classifiers.
Integrates fuzzy logic and neural network optimization for more accurate and interpretable predictions.
- **Real-World Educational Application**: Enables early identification of at-risk students.
Supports data-driven educational interventions and decision-making.


## Applications
- **Early Identification of At-Risk Students**
- **Personalized Learning and Adaptive Education**
- **Data-Driven Educational Interventions**
- **Enhanced Decision-Making for Institutions**
- **Academic Policy and Resource Planning**

## Prerequisites 
- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Required libraries**: numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib scipy fuzzy / skfuzzy tensorflow / keras joblib 
- **Early Identification of At-Risk Students**
- **Early Identification of At-Risk Students**





## Evaluation Metrics
<p>The performance of the student performance prediction models is evaluated using standard classification metrics derived from the confusion matrix:</p>

- **True Positives (TP):** Number of students correctly predicted as “passed".
- **True Negatives (TN):** Number of students correctly predicted as “failed.”
- **False Positives (FP):** Number of students incorrectly predicted as “passed.”
- **False Negatives (FN):** Number of students incorrectly predicted as “failed.”
